# Nerd Herd User Manual v2.0 (Intelligence Release)

## Overview
Nerd Herd 2.0 introduces the **Serendipity Engine** and a new **Liquid Glass Design**. This major update transforms the app from a simple study spot finder into an intelligent collaboration platform.

## New Feature: Serendipity Engine
The Serendipity Engine connects you with peers who are struggling with similar subjects nearby, enabling spontaneous "nerd herds."

### How to Use "Struggle" Mode
1.  **Access:** Tap the orange **S.O.S Button** (Life Ring icon) on the bottom left of the Map.
2.  **Signal:** Select the subject you are struggling with and your confidence level (e.g., "Helping" vs "Needing Help").
3.  **Broadcast:** This broadcasts a **Struggle Signal** to nearby users.
4.  **Connect:** If a match is found (e.g., someone nearby can help with Calculus), you will receive a notification to connect.

### Ghost Mode vs. Study Mode
-   **Live (Study) Mode:** You are visible on the map to selected peers. Your location updates in real-time.
-   **Ghost Mode:** You are invisible. You cannot see others live, and they cannot see you. Enable this via the Eye icon on the Map.

## New Design: Liquid Glass
The app now features a modern, translucent design optimized for both Light and Dark modes.
-   **Glass Drawers:** Profile and details sheets now use a blur effect.
-   **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and cards react with haptic feedback and dynamic scaling.

## Functional Guide

### Map Interface
-   **Search This Area:** If you move the map, tap "Search This Area" at the top to find spots in the new location.

    -   Tutors vs. Students
    -   Subjects (e.g., Math, Science)
    -   Verified vs. Public Spots

### Chat & Collaboration

4.  **Ghost Toggle:** Turn on Ghost Mode and verify your avatar disappears.

## Troubleshooting
