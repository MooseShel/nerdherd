# Agent Rules & Guidelines

## General Workflows
1.  **Manual Steps Notification**: 
    -   **Rule**: Always explicitly notify the user of ANY manual steps required to complete a task or make a change take effect.
    -   **Examples**: Executing SQL scripts in a remote DB, setting environment variables, manual deployments, enabling Supabase extensions (like pg_cron).
    -   **Action**: Provide the exact scripts or commands needed and clearly state "You must run this manually".
